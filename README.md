# Virtua-ZigZag
Virtua Zig-Zag is a 3D platformer where the player will have to test his/her patience and reaction skills to point. Unlike traditional 3D platformer games, Virtua Zig-Zag is an infinite runner. The Sphere is the player object. It’s all about timing and perfection to get the highest point. The objective of this game is to challenge yourself and play with your friends to see who can score more point and has better reflexes.
Virtua Zig-Zag is an arcade platform game where you control a little black ball that you have to try to take as far as you can through a maze filled with dangerous corners. 
Gameplay in Virtua Zig-Zag is very simple, but that doesn't mean it's easy. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. Lasting more than 30 seconds in a Virtua Zig-Zag game is a challenge that you'll have only your fingertip to get you through: tap the screen once to make the black ball rotate one way, tap twice and it will change direction. It's that simple and yet so complicated at the same time.
Your aim in Virtua Zig-Zag is to do as many direction changes as possible, which typically requires you to go very far. On the way, you can also pick up coloured crystals that will give you extra points. 
Virtua Zig-Zag is an addictive and quite lovely game where you can play quick rounds lasting from a couple seconds to one or two minutes.
